      <h2 class="topics">in the beginning.</h2>
      <p class="blocks">It all began with a hardcore brainstorming session. I thought to myself, <i>what kind of designer are you? What kind of message do you want to send to the people visiting your site?</i> The answers to these questions were not so simple. So, I began looking online for inspiration.</p>

      <h2 class="topics">what i didn't love.</h2>
      <p class="blocks">While I'm all about small details and busy <a href="art.html" id="art-page">artwork</a>, I appreciate clean and intuitive web interfaces. I started building my site with a bootstrap theme, but I began to take issue with it, because I wanted something more simple.</p>
      
      <div class="old-site">
          <img src="portfolio/website/website.gif" id="website"/>
      </div>
      
      <h2 class="topics">i finally had it.</h2>
      <p class="blocks">I decided to completely scrap my bootstrapped site, and started building from scratch. <br> <br> I love a thoughtful use of whitespace, so I wanted to make sure that I had just the right amount in my new site. I began experimenting with font pairings, colour schemes, and animations. Eventually, it all came down to this.</p>
