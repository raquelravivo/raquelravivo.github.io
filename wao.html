      <p class="blocks">I created the app interface on Sketch, as well as the website graphics using Adobe Illustrator. I crafted the user experiences to cater to the context in which one would use this app, and designed based off of user intuition.</p>
      
      <h2 class="topics">problem.</h2>
      <p class="blocks">Victims of abuse don’t always feel comfortable sharing their stories, especially if they are still living with the abuse. Many fear that leaving their partner will put them in even more harm, or threaten the safety of their loved ones. Victims may even stay in an abusive relationship because they are financially dependent on their partner, and leaving them will involve a choice between abuse and poverty. <br> <br> The question is, what platform can we provide victims with so that they can find resources that specifically target their individual case? After all, every case is different, so it only makes sense that certain action plans work for a handful of people, but pose dangers to others. </p>
      
      <h2 class="topics">so, what did we create?</h2>
      <p class="blocks">Over the course of a 24 hour hackathon, my team and I developed a platform that allows abuse victims to report their case, and find both immediate and long term support. Furthermore, a victim would fill out a form outlining the details of their case. Then, these details would be run through an algorithm that uses machine learning to iteratively learn from the information being entered. Key words within the report would be detected, and a “plan of action” would be generated based on the details of the report. More specifically, a victim would receive suggestions that are directly catered to their situation, such as nearby therapists, support groups, shelters, or literature that discusses action plans related to their case. <br> <br> Our upmost priority is maintaining the anonymity of users and ensuring the user friendliness of our application, as it may be used in tense, severe scenarios. </p>

      <p class="blocks">With the support of GreenHouse, the University of Waterloo’s social impact incubator, as well as mentors from Conrad and Communitech, we continue to move through the prototyping stages of our product. We are taking this time to explore the the issue further so that we can get to know our potential users and understand how we can better accommodate them. In turn, we hope to implement more relevant resources and design our user flow based around feedback gathered from usability interviews, before proceeding with development.</p>
